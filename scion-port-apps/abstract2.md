## Long Abstract

Building and operating reliable distributed systems is an ongoing challenge. This challenge increases exponentially
in a distributed system that traverses a wide area network like the public internet where traffic disruptions
and recovery arent self determinate.

NATS provides a system that's easier than most other distributed systems.

When message traffic inevitably traverses a wide area network like the public
internet and BGP, y more variability is injected into message delivery.


What if there was a way to improve upon the underlying network connectivity that a
distributed system relies upon? The SCiON (Scalability, Control, and Isolation On Next-Generation Networks)
Internet Architecture aims to offer secure, highly available, and efficient point-to-point packet delivery
via a path-aware network. What's required to port over an existing distributed system technology to use such
a network? Port NATS to run on top of SCiON, what were the realized benefits in practice? Was NATS more available
and robust than it would have been in a traditional wide area network?

## Short Abstract

What if it were possible to replace IP and BPG? The SCiON (Scalability, Control, and Isolation On Next-Generation Networks)
Internet Architecture is a secure, highly available, and efficient path-aware network. What kinds of benefits could be
realized when SCiON is combine with a distributed systems software like NATS after +50 years of IP dominance?
