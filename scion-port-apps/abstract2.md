## Long Abstract

Building and operating reliable distributed systems is an ongoing challenge. This challenge increases exponentially
in a distributed system that traverses a wide area network like the public internet where traffic disruptions
and recovery arent self determinate.

Neural Autonomic Transport System (NATS) is an established, distributed messaging system that's operates in a wide range
of use cases. What improvements are possible to the underlying network that this distributed system relies upon?

The SCiON (Scalability, Control, and Isolation On Next-Generation Networks)
Internet Architecture aims to offer secure, highly available, and efficient point-to-point packet delivery
via a path-aware network (PAN). What was required to port NATS to use SCiON natively?
What were the results in practice over a traditional wide area network and BGP?

## Short Abstract

What if it were possible to replace IP and BPG? The SCiON (Scalability, Control, and Isolation On Next-Generation Networks)
Internet Architecture is a secure, highly available, and efficient path-aware network. What kinds of benefits could be
realized when SCiON is combine with a distributed systems software like NATS after +50 years of IP dominance?
