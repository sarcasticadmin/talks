# Ansible out, Nix in

## Overview

Ansible has served the SCaLE tech team for several years. Unfortunately, Ansible suffers from the same limitations that any configuration
management solution has. In the search to ease management of the conference servers,
the tech team's opted for a different approach using Nix and NixOS. We'll cover the longstanding challenges of managing SCaLE's servers
and services and why it made sense to move over to a full declarative distribution and package manager. What benefits Nix has enabled
for the tech team going into, during SCaLE 20x, and beyond.

Well cover:

  - How lazy Id like to be when managing systems
  - The challenges config management claims to solve
  - The typical, traditional server prepration and updates prior to each SCaLE conference
  - What Nix and NixOS are
  - Why Nix over traditional config management
  - How Nix makes it possible to solve the annual needs of the SCaLE conference
  - Additional benefits that we get in the Nix ecosystem
